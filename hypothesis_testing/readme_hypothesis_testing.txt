This folder contains all the necessary files for the hypothesis testing. It is self-contained except for ../data-clean folder which contains the necessary input data. 

The analysis was carried out in two different computational environments (one Windows 11, one Ubuntu 24.04), both using Conda virtual environments. Requirements files for both are provided. 

The "plus" notebook contains additional analysis using the log odds ratio to determine potential difference between the conferences. However, it uses a different classification for the potential reproducibility than the rest of the analysis and is therefore not included in the main study.
