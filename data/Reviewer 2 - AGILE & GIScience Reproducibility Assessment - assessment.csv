Paper presents a framework for categorising citizen science interactions. The framework is then applied to the BioSenCS project as a case study.There is no computational analysis in this sense. The BioSenCS implementation is then presented as part of the paper. The code is available via GitHub and archived via SoftwareHeritage. A usability study was conducted, but the questionnaire, questions and raw results are not available. As the implementation is also presented in another paper and the focus here seems to be on the framework, I categorise this paper as conceptual paper.  ",NA,NA
